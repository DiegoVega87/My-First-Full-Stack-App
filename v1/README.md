# My-First-Full-Stack-App

This repo contains my first Full Stack Web Application

Steps followed:
-- 1 Created index.html file with the content to be displayed.
-- 2 Created style.css file to provide syle and aesthetics to the webapp
-- 3 Created the script.js to manipulate the DOM and make the webApp interactive.
-- 4 Used react to create the app and saved the old files in folder v1 to keep them for future reference when manipulating the DOM
through React.

Potential challenges in this project include managing state, handling asynchronous updates, and ensuring that the UI correctly reflects the current state of the application.
